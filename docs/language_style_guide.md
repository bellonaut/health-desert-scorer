# Health Desert Scorer - Language Style Guide

This guide is for all public-facing text in the application, documents, and presentations.

## Core principles
- Use plain, direct language.
- Focus on barriers and systems, not blame.
- Keep wording neutral, practical, and decision-safe.
- Avoid emojis and informal internet language.

## Avoid (deficit or blame framing)
- "Worst LGAs"
- "Failing areas"
- "Problem communities"
- "Underperforming regions"
- "Poor people" or "helpless populations"

## Use (barrier and support framing)
- "Highest-need LGAs"
- "Access barriers"
- "Under-resourced areas"
- "Priority for support"
- "Areas facing systemic constraints"

## Standard phrasing examples

### Risk language
- Avoid: "This LGA has poor access"

### Rankings
- Avoid: "Bottom 10 LGAs"
- Use: "10 LGAs with the highest access barriers"

### Recommendations
- Avoid: "This area needs fixing"
- Use: "Priority for targeted outreach and infrastructure support"

### Data quality
- Avoid: "Bad data quality"
- Use: "Limited data availability; interpret with caution"

## NGO-facing writing checklist
- Can a non-technical program manager understand this in one read?
- Does this sentence avoid blaming communities?
- Does this statement include an implementation-oriented action?
- Does the wording clearly separate "signal" from "proof"?
